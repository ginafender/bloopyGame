# Bloopy Game

## Project Description

This is a personal project that started as a school assingment. The assignment was to create a very basic personal website, but I really wanted to challenge myself and incorporate a browser game. This is my first game, and since I am wanting to get into game development, I am excited about how much I have learned throughout this process. 

# File Structure
The files for the home page consist of:
- index.html
- styles.css

The files for the game page include:
- game.html
- gamescripts.js
- gamestyles.css
- Images in the images folder
  
## Game Logic
The logic for bloopy was built using vanilla Javascript and HTML.
